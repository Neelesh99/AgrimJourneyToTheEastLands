# AgrimJourneyToTheEastLands

=====

## The Journey Begins
Our Intrepid Hero wakes up in a foreign land, the morning sun illuminating his surroundings. As he wakes from his slumber he become acutely aware that he is not alone. In the middle distance, a bald figure emerges from the thick blanket of mist. This main was not of this ethereal plane, instead he floated above the ground effortlessly, saving massively on shoe costs. For all his talents though, the monk seemed emotionless, unable to feel, but our boi Agrim did not yet know the magnitude of the event he was about to witness. For here in the highest and most frigid of mountains, this monk would have to learn to feel. The challenge ahead would be difficult and filled with setbacks, but if he perservered he would experience the greatest treasure on earth, Microsoft's Vision API.
